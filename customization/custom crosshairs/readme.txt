To enable the crosshair, go to resource/crosshairs/crosshair.res and change the "visible" entry to "1"

You also should also disable the ingame crosshair by putting "cl_crosshair_scale 0" into the console

You can change the type of the crosshair by modifying the "labeltext" entry in crosshair.res
Each letter / symbol represents a different crosshair
Checkout the different options in the TF2Crosshairs.png

Colors can be changed in crosshair_colors.res and crosshair_hitmarker.res

For the rest, just read crosshair_scheme.res and crosshair.res
